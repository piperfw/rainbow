RAINBOW(1)

NAME
	rainbow - Format and print text with fun colours

OPTIONS

	-a, --all
		Turn on most colours and decorations, and randomise. Equivalent to -b -bg -bf -dec -fg -r	

	-b, --blinking
		Make every other character blink. This is \x1B[3mnot\x1B[23m compatible with the -bg option.
		Note: The occurrence of blinking characters is reduced when used in conjunction with -dec.
	
	-bg, --background
		Apply background colouring to the text. By default, the foreground text will be white,
		although this is changed if -fg, -bf or -nwf is used.

	-bf, --black-foreground
		By default, black foreground (text) is not used with the -fg option.
		This option changes this behaviour. Recommended when using light terminal themes.

	--clear
		Clear the console window before printing.

	-d, --dim
		Use ordinary colouring. By default, 'bright' colours are used.

	-dec, --decoration
		Apply decorations (regular, bold, italic and underlined) to the text.

	-f, --file \x1B[3mfile\x1B[23m
		Format and print a text file. \x1B[3mfile\x1B[23m should be a full path name or a path name 
		relative to the current working directory.

	-fg, --fg
		Apply foreground colouring to the text. This is the most customary option.

	-h, --help
		Display this message.

	--home
		Move the cursor to the top left-hand corner of the screen before printing (this should really 
		only be used in conjunction with --clear).

	-nwf, --no-white-foreground
		Do \x1B[3mnot\x1B[23m use white as a foreground (text) colour. Recommended when using light terminal themes.

	-r, --randomise
		Randomise the order in which formatting is applied. Otherwise the default ordering is used:
		(Black,) Red, Green, Yellow, Blue, Magenta, Cyan, White for foreground and background colours,
		and Regular, Bold, Italic, Underlined for decorations.
		
	\x1B[3mstring\x1B[23m
		Format and print \x1B[3mstring\x1B[23m. If used, this must be the \x1B[3mfirst\x1B[23m argument.
		If \x1B[3mstring\x1B[23m contains spaces, it must be placed in single or double quotes. Note
		that any escape codes here will be ignored.

	-w, --words
		Format text by word instead of character.
